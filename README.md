# TimeHistoryProcessing
These are my python codes for time history record processing, which I wrote for my final year project.
Seismic time history records come in different formats and need to be converted to the format which is suitable for analysis software.
There is also a file for plotting data from GeoStudio. For the calculation of RotD50, a python library pyrotd was used.
